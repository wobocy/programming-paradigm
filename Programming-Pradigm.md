# Programming Paradigm
## Definition
Solving a programming problem requires choosing the right concepts.   
A programming paradigm is an approach to programming a computer based on a mathematical theory or a coherent set of principles for a certain kind of problem. Each paradigm supports a set of programming concepts that makes it the best for this problem. The concepts are basic primitive elements used to construct the paradigms, the paradigm is emerged from those concepts.
* Paradigms are not islands, they have a lot in common.
* Each language realizes one or more paradigms because languages are designed for solving different kind of problems. Those languages typically includes one paradigm for programming in the small which is chosen for the kind of problem most frequently targeted by this language, one paradigm for programming in large which is chosen to support abstraction and modularity.

## Paradigm Properties
### 1 observable nondeterminism
### 2 how strongly they support state

## Paradigm Classification
* 

## Programming Concepts(four most important)
1. Records  
Records is a data structures: a group of references to data items with indexed access to each item.(just like structs ) Record is the foundation of symbolic programming(of cource, there is graphic programming). A sysmbolic programming language is able to: 
   * calculate with records
   * create new records
   * decompose records
   * examine records
2. Lexically scoped closures
Lexically scoped cl
3. Independency(concurrency)
4. Named state

## Data abstraction


## Type
类型，定义了一个变量取值，可作用域变量的操作。如基础类型，int float等，对象和函数也有自己的类型。类型可以分为三类： 
* first class   
该类型的变量的值可以作为函数的参数和返回值，也可以赋给变量。
* second class  
该类型的值可以作为函数的参数，但不能从函数返回，也不能赋给变量。
* third class   
该类型的值作为函数参数也不行

## Scope
1. Function Scope
any variable which is defined within a function is visible within that entire function.
2. Block Scope  
any variable which is defined within a block is visible within that entire block. a block can be expressed as {} or for(xx){} 
3. Lexical Scoping  
Lexical Scoping defines how variable names are resolved in nested functions. Other names of Lexical Scoping are Static Scoping or Closure.
