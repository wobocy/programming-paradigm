# Programming Paradigm
## Definition
Solving a programming problem requires choosing the right concepts. All but the smallest toy problems require different sets of concepts for different parts. This is why programming languages should support many paradigms.   
A programming paradigm is an approach to programming a computer based on a mathematical theory or a coherent set of principles. Each paradigm supports a set of concepts that makes it the best for a certain kind of problem.
* Each paradigm consists of a set of concepts.
* paradigms are not islands, they have a lot in common.
* Each language realizes one or more paradigms.


## Two Properties of Programming Paradigm
### 1 observable nondeterminism
### 2 how strongly they support state

## Four Most Important Programming Concepts
1. Records
2. Lexically scoped closures
3. Independency(concurrency)
4. Named state
